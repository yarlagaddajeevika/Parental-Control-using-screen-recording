# Parental-Control-using-screen-recording

### A little background on what this project is going to be.

Perfect parenting is a myth, but every parent makes an effort to raise happy, motivated,
well-behaved, problem-free children. In this enduring journey, they need to help the kids
perform in their chosen field, help them stay focused, and away from distractions or
inappropriate web content. Parents themselves need help from grandparents, schools,
teachers, and neighbors and sometimes they look for aids/tools that are technologically
more advanced than their own knowledge.

The list of ill effects of too much screen time for children is growing, having bad effects
on health, vision, and school performance. Managing screen time is a challenge even for
adults. They seek help from some apps and time management tools to stay on course.
Given this, keeping a kid away from gadgets and screens, and monitoring what content is
being watched has become a greater challenge with this generation of kids that have iPads,
smartphones, and other playing devices readily available in the household. Kids neither
prefer nosy parents nor prefer parents intervene with their routine. Moderation and
regulation are key to raising healthy children. To get there, monitoring their screen time is
important. Activity report with highlighted data is vital. Yet times, the details cannot be
ignored.

Based on the above generic problem, it is clearly established that there is a need for a
solution that parents are looking for in terms of getting an activity report and an in-depth
review of content watched by their kids. Since we are talking about monitoring tools for
kids and not adults and by their own parents, the privacy concerns can be safely ignored
in the solution proposed.
